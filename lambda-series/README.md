# Creating your own language with the lambda calculus as the core.

## Implementation

Build and install using stack via `stack install`.

Get stack here: http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/
(will automatically pull in GHC and all the requirements for you).

## Rough idea for the list of topics:
    
 - Session 1: Intro to the syntax and concepts of the lambda calculus, 
    including operational semantics.
    
 - Session 2: A first implementation: parsing, printing, and interpreting 
    the lambda calculus (written in Haskell)
 - Session 3: More on the implementation of a simple language based on 
    the Lambda Calculus
 - Session 4: Formally defining a type system via the simply-typed lambda 
    calculus
 - Session 5: Algorithmically defining a type system: type checking and 
    type inference
 - Session 6: Recursion and strong normalisation theorems
 - Session 7: Extending our implementation with some more features
 - Session 8: The Curry-Howard correspondence (types vs. logic)
 - Session 9: Polymorphism (System F)
 - Session 10: Implementing polymorphic types (Hindley-Milner algorithm 
    and related).
